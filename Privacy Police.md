# General 
Trunal is designed to completely respect your privacy. The developer is working hard to ensure that your journals are kept as they should: private. 

Therefore no third party libraries or frameworks are used. Everything is built from scratch with the APIs provided by Apple. No third parties are involved to collect or analyze your personal data. Every data created is stored fully encrypted on the device. No services are used to track, analyze or identify the user.

In the future full encrypted iCloud synchronization will be enabled to share data across multiple devices. Please read Apple’s privacy police for iCloud to ensure that you agree with it before enabling this feature (you can find it [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)).

# Sensitive user or device data

Trunal may request permission to use sensitive user data or device data – such as your location, contacts or photos (list not completely). These information are never leaving the users device or iCloud and are not within requested without any purpose. It is up to the user to give those permissions or not. Trunal can handle it either way. These optional features are:

## Location 
If you provide access to your location, you are able to store places for each of your journal entries. You also can view your entries on Apple maps.

## Photos
By providing access to your photos, you can add an unlimited number of photos for each entry. Your selected photos will be copied into the document space of Trunal.

# Other data

## Log files
Information about occurring errors within the app are stored locally on your device. You may choose to share these files via email with the developer to help improving Trunal. Log files do not contain any personal data but may include your device type (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro Max).

## Import/Export 
You can import and export your data as JSON-Files. All data are packed in a none encrypted archive file. You can unpack these archives and read them with any text editor.

## Remove data
As an user of Trunal you have the right to delete your personal data at any time. You always can delete your data by tapping the provided buttons in the settings of the app. The data is removed completely without any restrictions. 

This privacy policy is changing from time to time, although the philosophy won’t change. In the future more features will be implemented. You get notified about changes within the app.
